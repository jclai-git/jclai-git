Hi, I’m Joyce Lai (@jclai-git)!

I’m currently learning control theory, ladder logic, python, CVX.

I am interested in optimal control, statistical learning, and self-learning systems for robotic applications.

My GitHub includes (and is in the process of being populated with) class projects I have done during my undergrad.
